Testing komplex_add:
a= (1, 2i)
b= (3, 4i)


Testing the komplex add function:
a+b should be equal to (4, 6i)
a+b is actually equal to (4, 6i)


Testing complex subtraction function:
a-b should be equal to (-2, -2i)
a-b is actually equal to (-2, -2i)


Testing complex new and set functions:
Our complex new function gives us (5, 3i)
while our complex set function changes it to (2, 7i)
