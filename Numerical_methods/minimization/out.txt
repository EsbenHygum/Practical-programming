Testing minimization methods on Rosenbrock's function:
Using Newton's method yields a minimum at [1.00;1.00] with 210 steps
Using the quasi Newton analytical method yields a minimum at [1.00;1.00] with 21782 steps
The analytic root-finding function yields a minimum at [1.00;1.00] with 759 steps
The initial guess was [2.00;1.00]


Testing minimization methods on Himmelblau's function:
Using Newton's method yields a minimum at [3.00;2.00] with 81 steps
Using the quasi Newton analytical method yields a minimum at [3.00;2.00] with 152 steps
The analytic root-finding function yields a minimum at [3.00;2.00] with 23 steps
The initial guess was [2.00;1.00]
